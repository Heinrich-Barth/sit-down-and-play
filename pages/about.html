                <h1>About</h1>

                <p>This project allows you to play your favourite card game online.</p>
                
                <h2>Importantly</h2>
                <p>Middle-earth CCG and LotR are trademarks of Middle-earth Enterprises and/or Iron Crown Enterprises. </p>

                <h2>General Data Protection Regulation Notice (GDPN)</h2>
                <p>This application runs on a host which may store personal data. Please consult their GDPN for specific information.
                    No data is collected by this application, nor does it forward any to a third party. 
                    Cookies are stored in such a whay that it can only be accessed by the browser.</p>

                <h2>Cookie Information</h2>
                <p>To play a game, you need to allow the site to store certain cookies in your browser. The cookies are only accessed by the server to
                    make sure you can actually play a game. The following cookies are stored:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>room</b> - the name of the game</li>
                    <li><b>username</b> - your display name when creating/joining a game</li>
                    <li><b>userid</b> - a unique id necessary to associate your in-game data.</li>
                    <li><b>joined</b> - the time at which you joined (necessary to identify idle or inactive games)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The <b>userid</b> is only used for in-game actions. It is created anew each time you start or join a game. 
                    Importantly, it is not associated with your <b>username</b> outside of your active game.</p>

                <h2>Security Measurements</h2>
                <p>This site does not require any databases or other storage containers.</p>
                <p>All card images are requested from a content delivery server (CDS) to keep images and this application separate.</p>

                <p>To avoid cross-site-scripting attacks from your game opponents, the following <b>Content-Security-Policy</b> and <b>X-Content-Security-Policy</b> are applied in a game:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>default-src 'self'</li>
                    <li>script-src 'self'</li>
                    <li>img-src 'self' (and the CDS)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Content-Security-Policy violation attempts can be reported depending on the host's configuration.</p>
